# LibraryProject

This is my first Django project created for learning purposes.

## Project Structure
- **manage.py**: Command-line utility for running and managing the project.
- **settings.py**: Main configuration file (database, apps, middleware, etc.).
- **urls.py**: URL declarations (routing).
- **wsgi.py / asgi.py**: Entry points for deployment.
